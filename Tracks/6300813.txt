I do not know what is going on there, the curtains are swinging, the chandelier is shaking, and God forbid to draw attention - such company\n\n\nThey went to the club with their friends from the University of Warsaw\nThey took a few shots and expect miracles\nThey expеcted miracles, did not expеct dirt\nThey wanted hits, but they only hear the lube-dub\nLet us live the president, that is, the club!@#s DJ\nHe mixes something there and feels a lot of hardship\nAnd our friends, as beautiful as Barbie dolls\nAt the end of the dance, they look like voodoo dolls\nOne gentleman is driving like he has eight dicks\nRay ban at the club? He probably thinks there!@#s Bono from U2\nThat white raven ... He liked it quickly\nRed lipstick, black pin, red wine in the brain\nAnd want for white, He!@#s a fan of the White Stripes\nSo he invites to his place, there is little space for dancing\nShould I go fraternize with you, away from this crowd?\nIt!@#s time for a concert, I think you have to ask the choir\n\nIt doesn!@#t matter, it doesn!@#t matter\nTake it, eat it when it lies like wood\nLet him come in, let him in\nStraight into the blood, heart and core, whatever, whatever\nEvery king will drop his scepter sometime\nIt doesn!@#t matter, it doesn!@#t matter\nThe walls around your heart will fall\nI ... will die today and you with me\n\n\nHe!@#s following the Prince, one or two, and there!@#s already a taxi waiting for them\nThe tension keeps rising, so this woman gets in\nLady want to clap, apartment in the city center?\nShe would be lowered to sleep here\nFirst - drugs, then - the magic of music\nHe grabbed the port bottle and drank a quarter\nNow his nostrils are panting like two black bulls\nFirst there were tender words, then nightmarish screams\nThe spell came true, uh-huh, the spell came true\nShe squeaks like a deer, and he will destroy the deer\nThe deer!@#s mind sparkles, the phone screams and squeaks\nAnd our hero shouted loudly, and now he is silent\nSheepskin, wolf!@#s appetite\nIn the morning he would dump it on bottles of wine and he drank three\nShe leaves, he spots some bottle of rum\nDo you drink anything else? I think he has to go ask the choir\n\nIt doesn!@#t matter, it doesn!@#t matter\nTake it, keep on drinking, then you!@#ll lie down like wood\nJust open your mouth and pour the contents inside\nStraight into the blood, heart and core, whatever\nEvery king will drop his scepter sometime\nIt doesn!@#t matter, it doesn!@#t matter\nThe walls around your heart will fall\nI ... will die today and you with me\n\n\nA beautiful Warsaw Friday, full of snacks and snacks\nAnd people who lose the plot\nAlcohol is pouring, and the place is full today\nOur heroine follows someone with her eyes\nHe is looking for the Prince\nFor the sake of rhyme, we!@#ll name him Peter\nShe wrote for seven days, now she is afraid that this Peter has broken\nAnd for her, He!@#s a fillet mignon\nIn this country where every boy is like a minced cutlet\nFor her, He is more or less Jude Law\nIn a country where every boy is eaten and bland\nNow she sees him somewhere in the background, so he catches his breath\nI think he noticed her too, but he acted mean\nThey ran out of cigarettes, she concluded\nTo talk to gentlemen who don!@#t speak Polish\nThen he comes back inside, sees that some fagot\nPeter talks to her, whore\nWith that many people talking to her boy? Fucking record!\nA mouth like Brodka and a neckline up to the twelfth rib\nShe wears pipes and pins, He buys her drinks\nAnd he flicks his coat keys with a loud clatter\nThe mouth is ajar and her eyes ask\nAbout his insides, he takes a breath and rises up his chest\nPeter sees it and orders Taxi Grosik\nThinking about what kind of drink to host my friend\n\nIt doesn!@#t matter, it doesn!@#t matter\nTake it, keep on drinking, then you!@#ll lie down like wood\nJust open your mouth and pour the contents inside\nStraight into the blood, heart and core, whatever\nEvery king has dropped his scepter once\nIt doesn!@#t matter, it doesn!@#t matter\nThe walls around your heart will fall\nI ... will die today and you with me\n\n\nOur heroine wants to cry\nAnd eat Mac, he!@#s close to the Escarpment, he!@#ll go jumping\nAfter all, she also has a nice body, a lovely belly and tits\nBut she does have those long calves\nOur heroine!@#s heart broke more than once\nBut what she sees now is almost killing her\nBehold, they pass by her, ladies, gentlemen, what a scene!\nPeter nodded and said: $%^Oh, hey!$%^\n$%^Shit. Oh hi? Mr. Bohema?\nCondoms? Oh, I don!@#t!\nLadies quick orgasm, watch out because I!@#m shooting\nLord, do I play Jack White when I undress the girl? $%^\nSuddenly the music stops and Peter swallows\nBecause in his head there is very fast math\nSmiling beautifully, she takes the other!@#s hand\nA few steps forward and they get into Grosik'}
