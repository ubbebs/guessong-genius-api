Waiters, bosses, gods of night and day, big and small, in the bar and in cocktail bar, in the bar, and behind the scenes\n\n\nThe first thing to go is (my) sense of rhythm\nBut I!@#m thinking: $%^Hey, maybe something good will come out of it $%^\nThen I!@#m thinking: $%^Christ, why do I have to be here$%^\nBut third tequila bottle kills the sense of shame\nThe parquet palled on everyone I don!@#t have to hide it anymore\nThat alcohol is dancing with me, waltz after waltz\nFirst we dance tango, then something inspired by the samba\nI!@#m spinning down the Karowa to go back up along Tamka\nI!@#m peering at teenagers. Before they used to go out rarely\nNow they fell into this city swamp and keep lying to their mothers\nNaked legs wearing high heels, I wonder what daddy says\nI crossed the road on a red light, I get a ticket. Awesome\nIt will suck in the morning, now I don!@#t give a shit\nThe truth is, I haven!@#t gone out for so long...\nI go back to Krakowskie and fall, I don!@#t know what I fell on\nAll I hear is laugh of these girls stupid and fat just like\nGrzegorz Lato\n\nAnd nearby at Zakąski behind the bar Mr. Roman boogies and jumps into conversations\nAnd nearby at Kamienie all husbands are gone so thatch widows give each other wet kisses\nAnd nearby at Bistro, loves tend to bind quickly and trail away the next day\nWarsaw triangle. Warsaw triangle\n\n\nTo get your ass kicked at Subway at Swietokrzyska\nFirst of all in Warsaw you have to be an athlete\nTalking with this brain-chopped bouncer went down to nothing\nI won!@#t go back to Karowa today tho!@#. What a cheek\nI go out on a street and go down to Powisle\nAnd I wade through this winding road, my phone is beeping loudly\nI!@#m losing my patience and health !@#cause the ginger girl is calling\nAnd when she gets at me I!@#ll pretend that I can!@#t hear her again\nI go straight forward and pass the BUW\nMy phone is yelling at me, I can see she!@#s texting again\n(I guess) I!@#ll hail a cab. I!@#ve already spent a few hundred\n(Like 3) I!@#m still going and I can smell Vistula!@#s filth\nCigs, urine, vodka and sweat. It!@#s a strange stench\nAnd on the other side of Vistula there are other folks prowling\nA true dream, we!@#re fit, yoghurts and mead\nAnd they don!@#t fool around and the cig is smouldering\nWarsaw, torn apart by a thick line\nI!@#m closing cab!@#s door. $%^To Mazowiecka, please$%^\nThe driver!@#s prattling on about his poor life\nBut all I can hear is the laugh of the stupid and fat ones like Tomaszewski\n\nAnd nearby at Zakąski behind the bar Mr. Roman boogies and jumps into conversations\nAnd nearby at Kamienie all husbands are gone so thatch widows give each other wet kisses\nAnd nearby at Bistro, loves tend to bind quickly and trail away the next day\nWarsaw triangle. Warsaw triangle\n\n\nWarsaw triangle. Bermuda triangle\nGirls go backwards and the nipples go in front of them\nBoys seem to forget how short their lives are\nErnest was right. Take off these skinnies first\nDrink some vodka. 4 PLN for a shot\nDon!@#t call your friend. She won!@#t help you today\nIt!@#s adulthood, you!@#ve wanted it since elementary school, huh?\nI prefer Zozole. Whatever, fuck me, come on\nShe lives near my place so I!@#ll go to Kredytowa* with her\nA guy is staring at us with quite a vicious sight\nI!@#d like a minute of silence, she just keeps talking\nThat girl just keeps texting, Christ, what is it for?\nI!@#m Peter but they call me a Scoundrel\nI!@#ve had this alias for quite a while, but I don!@#t know why\n(You!@#ll find it) Wherever you can smell perfumes and cigs\nAnd in the girls!@# hearts still the lights were going off, and power was being cut (Cool, huh?)\nThat!@#s my line of thought. Do you wanna fuck?\nI!@#m not saying it out loud !@#cause it would be too radical\n$%^You can come in for a while but don!@#t await anything$%^\nAnd I!@#m going to overstay like Michal Listkiewicz\n\nPZPN, PZPN. Fuck, fuck PZPN\nPZPN, PZPN. Fuck, fuck PZPN\nPZPN, PZPN. Fuck, fuck PZPN\nPZPN, PZPN. Fuck, fuck PZPN\n\n\nAnd nearby at Zakąski behind the bar Mr. Roman boogies and jumps into conversations\nAnd nearby at Kamienie all husbands are gone so thatch widows give each other wet kisses\nAnd nearby at Bistro, loves tend to bind quickly and trail away the next day\nWarsaw triangle.
