They told me you left at \nAnd your lips were shining like July-grown cherries\n\nYou weren’t here again\nIf you didn’t exist, the city would be getting along better\nI am here. I’ve been there. Actually, who wasn’t?\nThe whole WWA is here, except for you\nI am here. I’ve been there. You’ve left with your friends\nOn this legs which I tend to call rifles\nSo, march, march!\nMarch, march, march!\n\n\nLooking for you in all the shot-bars\nWith your girls you look like at Oscars ceremony\nMy and my guys would propose you at sight\nStill we probably are just and bunch of faggots to y!@#all\nYou tie your hair in a bun\nAnd the world irritates you like Alutka irritates Jędrula\nYour bronchi probably hurt, and now you covered them with smoke\nAnd you order some vodka with Red Bull\nYou fly across the city like Blossom, Bubbles, Buttercup\nCarrying your attributes: vodka, champagne, rolling paper\nWild like desert, steppes, taiga and jungle\nAnd your eyelashes for men are like a chain for a hound\nYou’re looking for a lighter, I’d give you some fire\nAnd harass you with sight like a priest, who rapes with God\nMon dieu, you still love me, I don’t doubt that\nBut last Friday you’ve left with this Peter guy\n\nYou weren’t here again\nIf you didn’t exist, the city would be getting along better\nI am here. I’ve been there. Actually, who wasn’t?\nThe whole WWA is here, except for you\nI am here. I’ve been there. You’ve left with your friends\nOn this legs which I tend to call rifles\nSo, march, march!\nMarch, march, march!\n\n\nYou like all kind of muscles\nGesticulating, as if you had been taking matura again\nWhen I see you I have a big hole instead of my brain\nWant to go with you to restaurants, order couscous for two\nThen make love at night and in the morning have a pizza delivered to your room\n‘Cause you’re good and cool but your company!@#s unsuitable\nYou prefer cocaine in lofts, we would fancy a beer by Vistula\nMaybe I’ll catch you and make it a nightmare for you, so you’d dream about me?\nOk, I piled on it\nBut I probably ate too much jellied meat\nTomorrow there will be Tylenol, then milk and a latte\nAs long as I can I save myself with a double\nBitter ginger cloud’s raining again\nI wonder what you’re doing and where you put your steps\nAnd why you aren!@#t answering my texts, fuck, I beg you, answer me\nThere you are, I throw my flask, don’t have time to drink it\nAnd, then\nThe bottle shatters on the sidewalk\nA couple’s going to a cab, maybe that!@#s Grosik?\nAnd you yelling like crazy, nearing the guy\nAnd shout something which insinuates that, you do know each other from the past\nHow many seconds have passed? 3 at most\nHe takes that other girl and throws her in the cab\nIs that this Peter guy? For fuck’s sake, I’m so mad\nI’d throw a shoe at you if it wasn’t an Air Max\nTragically in love…\nI’d cheer you up but I gotta go home to drink till the dawn\nIt doesn’t matter if you love other gentlemen\nBut this douchebag known in the whole place?\nDrama\nI’ve been there. Actually who hasn’t?\nThe whole WWA is here, except for you…'}
