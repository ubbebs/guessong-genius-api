Maybe walk bare-fuckin’- foot?\nEverywhere these worn faces, swollen hands\nI look at folks and I congeal like an image\nThinking by the way, what really is my happiness?\nThis cheerful chorus plays on Bollywood’s other side\n\nWhere did all these Bollywood smiles go?\nWhy isn’t anyone dancing here?\nIf life’s hurtin’, well Look down on these colorful Nikes\nAll around these holy cows\nAnd people’s fate turns to pasture\nWelcome to the land of thousand gods\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\n\n\nOff the banknote Mahatma Gandhi grins\nA beggar asks for spares by this luxury Audi\nSome here say, your enemy’s joy is your sorrow\nI’ve heard many gods, Vishnu said it ain’t good\nNext to New Delhi starvation is like a penalty\n‘Round each corner, I didn’t come her to take a selfie\nI’d change the modus cause that is the real Mexico\nOne circles free like a bird, cause people are vultures\nNo respect, no smile, no reward\n‘Round me figures skinnier than on the covers of Vogue\nThey be askin’ for a bite as if for one day longer\nOne kid pulls my hoodie: “Are you the Guardian Angel?”\nNo! I’m the coward who was afraid to help\nNow I can’t look into eyes of folks like you\nCause here, eyes are askin’, bodies beggin’\nI’m ashamed of myself that sometimes I don’t finish a meal\nAm ashamed when I say “rapper” when these fags burn the banknotes\nWomen look as if we were to throw diamonds under their feet\nJust like A’isha, she prays to the heavens barefoot\nDressed in cashmere, at night someone raped her like an item\nPlay!\n\nWhere did all these Bollywood smiles go?\nWhy isn’t anyone dancing here?\nIf life’s hurtin’, well Look down on these colorful Nikes\nAll around these holy cows\nAnd people’s fate turns to pasture\nWelcome to the land of thousand gods\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\nWhere there ain’t enough god for everyone\n\n\nChewing paan i stare at this dirty note\nWe in the cab again\nThousands thoughts a minute, all deafened by a horn\nJasmin in the air, incense with miraculous smell\nHare Krishna I wear no moro, i ain’t got no gun in my hand\nOff the bank note grins Mahatma Gandhi Everyone fights like a sick fuck, think:\nEvery hour in the heart of India somebody drops dead Every second ladies with bindi turn into loot\nNo need to know hindi to understand sorrow I had the nerve to share what I make a minute'}
