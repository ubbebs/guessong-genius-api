Some tears, sometimes a delight\nThen: a sticky cobweb in an empty wallet\nLife is:\nRun with flags between the barricades\nWhile death chases and screams, $%^Stop, citizen!$%^\nPlease open the briefcase (okay)\nPlease give us your PESEL number (hmm, okay)\nPlease do not worry about the world and your own being\nPlease remember, there is no soul, you are just meat\nPlease give us with your PESEL number\n\n\nAll happy people: please stop pissing me off\nBecause all happy people are planning to break something today\nAnd all these beautiful teeth on the sidewalk will roll\nHow will you shine them all the time for me, damn it!\nThis is not a comedy, Antigone has a model to give you\nThere is to be a tragedy here, next to the ancient choir\nPlease go kill yourselves, seriously, I can give you a rope myself\nOr some rifle, but all of you go to sleep in coffins\nI don!@#t sleep, I drink energy drinks\nYou see, how am I supposed to sleep when damn screams are everywhere?\nI hear partygoers talking and sticky vomit\nAnd the violinist is also playing something under the window, although he creaks quite well ...\nBesides, I!@#m waiting, waiting for her call\nTobacco is spinning in the lungs and reinforced concrete is floating in the veins\nAnd my life is running out again, I am chasing the peloton again\nBut life is getting faster and is running away with my woman\nOil to sleep, leave sleep to the skeletons\nI am waiting for you in Plan B, I will be waiting here forever\nI am writing, and you will not, understand, you hurt and dishonor me\nI just saw, are you having fun in the city? Kill yourself\nStill waiting, Plac Zbwaiciela, come save me\nI won!@#t bite or shoot, come have a drink with me\nAfter all, I can see that you can see what I am writing to you here\nSo tomorrow I will write it down and make it all public\n\nSo many hours in Plan B alone\nYou were supposed to be my wife, but nothing!@#s changed\n\n\nLife is:\nRunning through space. Some tears, sometimes a delight\nThen: a sticky cobweb in an empty wallet\nLife is:\nRun with flags between the barricades\nWhile death chases and screams, $%^Stop, citizen!$%^\nPlease open the briefcase (okay)\nPlease give us your PESEL number (hmm, okay)\nPlease do not worry about the world and your own being\nPlease remember, there is no soul, you are just meat\nPlease give us with your PESEL number'}
