What fucking grey blocks?\nEverything here is vibrant - chicks, guys and Yorkies\nPurple bruises, probably because she was naughty\nHe has kefir for men, that well-balanced protein in the flavour of toffee\nMy country got out of a cage, now they!@#re lost\nMy country can be ruled by merely anyone\nIn my country education, only leads us to into darkness\nOn one side a market, the other Europe\n\nI dance the Polish Tango\nMy legs are covered in mud because the Vistula is a foggy swamp\nNational colours just like Santa Claus\nAnd that makes sense cause I stopped believing in Poland a long time ago\nI dance the Polish Tango\nMy legs are covered in mud because the Vistula is a foggy swamp\nNational colours just like Santa Claus\nAnd that makes sense, sense, sense, sense, sense...\n\n\nWho are you? A Polish kid (Polish kid)\nWhat!@#s your emblem? A bag of white dust (white dust)\nWhere do you live? In a guarded neighbourhood (guarded neighbourhood)\nIn which country? The fucked up one (uh)\nWhat!@#s the land? It!@#s my sandcastle (sandcastle)\nGained how? Through the propaganda of fear\nDo you love it? Very much I!@#m being honest, (I!@#m being honest)\nWhat do you believe in? I believe in nothing!\n\n\nWho are you? A Polish kid\nMy landscapes are beautiful but fucked up by billboards\nSometimes I see a friend on a skyscraper\nI ask them to stop, but they only laugh and say:\nOk, bro, you fucking-\nIn Warsaw, the whole block shakes\nWhen I listen to my previews, if I!@#m making you angry then call the pigs\nI hear the roosters somewhere on Muran√≥w, cause they crowed\nI hear the sirens they always howl, the sirens they!@#ve gone crazy\n\nI dance the Polish Tango\nMy legs are covered in mud because the Vistula is a foggy swamp\nNational colours just like Santa Claus\nAnd that makes sense cause I stopped believing in Poland a long time ago\nI dance the Polish Tango\nMy legs are covered in mud because the Vistula is a foggy swamp\nNational colours just like Santa Claus\nAnd that makes sense, sense, sense, sense, sense...\n\n\nTheir main mission is to tell you you!@#re living gloriously\nOnly you are right - The rest of the world is wrong\nThe horizon is amazing but try to look more narrowly\nLook more narrowly, look more narrowly\nThe enemies are vaccines and 5G\nAdults are taught through a random Facebook page\nYour nephew is a faggot, because it!@#s trendy\nAnd the most anti-Polish is the bashing of coal - you know?\nA little coal never killed nobody\nI smoke black gold with my bros\nAnyway - May God be with us, fuck you!\nThree hail Marys, hallelujah and fuck those fuckers up'}
