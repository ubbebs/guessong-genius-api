I got a couple personalities so stay with me\nIf you!@#re not liking what you!@#re hearing I can change the scheme\nAnd I can change the beat, like:\nMy girl pretty, my grades average\nSaying: fuck the city, cause I am a savage\nCutting bruises in my brain so I get the smartness\nBut I went too far, man, just get the bandage\nI need booze. A few sips help the sadness\nSwitch quicker than the motherfucking trends in Paris\nI!@#m both the Agent Harrises and the Tony Sopranoses\nCue a Rap Genius nerd with some boring analysis\nI!@#m the Gangeses and red wines flowing in palaces\nI!@#m the millionth rapper saying how fucking evil and bad he is\nChorus:\nThat!@#s boring\nClaiming you!@#re a fucking demon? (That!@#s boring)\nSaying you spray chicks with semen? (That!@#s boring)\nCrying we should respect the females? (So boring)\nBragging !@#bout your car and your nine? (That!@#s boring)\nComplaining about rapping !@#bout dimes? (That!@#s boring)\nRap purists go back to !@#95, go see Pac touring and go suck on his crack pipe\n\nVerse 2:\nI see. You fuckers are feisty\nCause I!@#m on my Ricky Ross, you!@#re mad cause I!@#m icy\nI wanna calm the fuck down, and light up a nice tree\nBut my own mind is going against me, like why me?\nI guess I!@#m the rap game!@#s Balotelli\nAll these big black Tobiases? I call!@#em Nelly\nGot Halle B sucking my D, don!@#t swallow, Berry-\nMy seed!@#s precious. If you do it I am carving your belly\nAll I do is fucking rap, and I!@#m not charging a penny\nYou say you got bars, true, but it!@#s not many\nI fuck your clique up, stab Carl, rob Lenny\nThen sip a Duff, watch some fucking Scrubs on the telly\nI spit that red hot fat fire Bronsonelli\nSlick white boy look, Tommy Carcetti\nBut I got the Omar brain, plus I got the Pollack flame\nPriest Robak shame,  really sonny you are not ready\nShots heavy. It!@#s Friday, I!@#m on my Sobotka\nOld Polish fuck, chugging beers, eating a babka\nThen I!@#m cruising !@#round the city with a bottle of vodka\nAnd a pretty young doll, but I!@#m calling her Lalka\nLike I!@#m motherfucking Prus, but my m√≥zg is Kafka\nAnd my music is red fuzzy, too, I!@#m Rothko\nCigarettes - I!@#m off those, I!@#m swimming in booze\nI ain!@#t got shit to lose, so I!@#m boasting I got flows\n\n(That!@#s boring)\nComparing your flows to rivers? (That!@#s boring)\nLove songs, like $%^her hips quiver$%^? (That!@#s boring)\nStill rhyming the words $%^nigga$%^ and $%^trigger$%^? (That!@#s boring)\nBragging !@#bout your bling and look? (That!@#s boring)\nShallow melodies on every hook?\nRap purists go back to !@#96, go compete with Lil!@# Kim over rights to Frank!@#s dick\n\n\nPac, Big L, Biggie\nProof, Big Pun, Eazy\nPimp C, ODB\nEy, ey, ey\nPac, Big L, Biggie\nProof, Big Pun, Eazy\nPimp C, ODB\nThat!@#s boring\nThat!@#s boring\nPam, pom, pam, pom, pam, pam, pom, that!@#s boring'}
