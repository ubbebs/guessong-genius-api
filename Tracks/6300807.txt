Take a say\nYou say: $%^fuck off$%^\nI go on with a heavy head like ZOMOwiec\n\nWell, do you remember ...\nHow did you say you love me?\nHow did you say you love me?\nLike you said that me ...\nThis dream covers the lungs like moss\nId, ego, superego - 0.7 out of three\nWell, do you remember ...\nHow did you say you love me?\nHow did you say you love me?\nLike you said that me ...\nThe avalanche of thoughts flies to the brow\nId, ego, superego - 0.7 out of three\n\n\nMy friends are doing business and I!@#m still nobody\nThey are common and I am still wild\nThey put the Vans in the closet, slowly wearing shoes\nAnd they get serious, they suddenly call their piss $%^urine$%^\nI run around town and chase you all the time\nI run like a headless chicken or like a reserve footballer\nI!@#m afraid to see you, so I drown these nerves in my drinks\nI have nerves of steel! Though probably not the stainless one\nI followed you and saw a lot\nLike how you disappear with him in a cheap taxi\nFor example, when you walk like a real deity and your step is clearly swayed with vodka\nI saw him too, he was walking around town, he looked creepy hunting for the sky\nHe lay on the ground and sang about the Polish Football Association and places swallowed by the past\nI saw a broken heart, I saw my legs running\nMe, you and Piotr ... This Warsaw trio, me and my Weltschmerz, I don!@#t know what to do\nThat black dress of yours, face buried in your hands\nOn my face make-up and torment, I write these words and my heart breaks\nA face so beautiful that I kneel\nAnd in my head a song, I go to the studio, songs attract me\nI will describe the Warsaw triangle, me and you, you and me and this cap\nI will describe dirt and luxury, money spent on water and caviar\nI go to the studio ... One last breath\nThis town still smells like slug and cauliflower'}
