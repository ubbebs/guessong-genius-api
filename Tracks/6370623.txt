(whole life), I!@#ve been looking for you here and there\nWhere have you been my whole life? (whole life), when I was alone\nWhen I was drеaming every day, like Vladimir Cauchеmar\nNow, everything is different, I’m glad I have you today\n\n\nI’m glad I have you today. (I’m glad I have you today, I’m glad I have you today)\nI’m glad I have you today\n\nAutumn put a gray filter on the windows\nMelancholy took my heart again\nI don!@#t know what I would do if I didn!@#t meet with you\nYou are the last sunbeam in my life\n\n\nWhen you are next to me, and I am next to you\nEverything seems simple, although it is not\nWhen you are next to me, even fear looks like an illusion (like an illusion)\nThe whole world doesn’t matter\nWhere have you been my whole life? (whole life), I!@#ve been looking for you here and there\nWhere have you been my whole life? (whole life), when I was alone\nWhen I was dreaming every day, like Vladimir Cauchemar\nNow, everything is different, I’m glad I have you today\n\n\nNow we go here, then we fly there\nGive me two years, and we!@#ll see the world\nToday we eat breakfast in this restaurant alone\nI used to eat breakfast in this restaurant by myself\nLet!@#s go to the bazaar and make a deal\nThen to the Vitkac for Louis Vuitton\nTo a restaurant without a Michelin star\nBut the dish is cooked by Michel Moran\nWe!@#re gonna spend a lot of money tonight, because the money is a wastepaper\nI’m taken over by emotions, there is no words that can describe it\nNo people that can take it from us, I order Bacardi, rum with Coke\nLet the world collapse, I live by this moment\nI live cause of you\n\nWhen you are next to me, and I am next to you\nEverything seems simple, although it is not\nWhen you are next to me, even fear looks like an illusion (like an illusion)\nThe whole world doesn’t matter\nWhere have you been my whole life? (whole life), I!@#ve been looking for you here and there\nWhere have you been my whole life? (whole life), when I was alone\nWhen I was dreaming every day, like Vladimir Cauchemar\nNow, everything is different, I’m glad I have you today'}
