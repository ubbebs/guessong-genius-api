Are we so far apart?\nBut despite this rush, I wake up smiling\nI wake up and I know no one will rap better\nI blindly believe in myself, which is why I resent me everywhere\nDo you want to drive me out? Fire up the beat - I have to go right now\n\nI feel that the whole world is waiting for me\nI will get it with what I have inside\nIf I have to be alone\nI want to fall there, I want to fall there\nAnd I know that the whole world is waiting above\nI will get it with what I have inside\nI!@#ve had a plan for a long time\nAlthough I am not alone\nI have to go(x4)\n\n\nI have a lot of stuff on my head  - babe, companies, homies, home\nSomeone is barking at us, still belching; Donkey Kong\nMy mom told me no one has everything ... mom\nAfter all, there!@#s nothing wrong with trying to\nThis system tells you to wait, I explain the message\nI!@#m getting off my new Mercedes by the old school, kid\nThicker neckline than my dean, Eureka\nThe same one who warned me not to fly away\nIt!@#s not time yet, the security will not teach me to live\nZero transportation, but now I!@#m VIP\nAnd I stick my fangs into the basement, the stage and so on\nI am a self-made-man, businessman, superman, oops ...\nI think I got overwhelmed\nBut there!@#s a phase so even Shazam doesn!@#t know what!@#s going on\nThere is a phase for winning\nSweet Jesus, I have tugged these bitter regrets too long on the cross\nHalfway through my childhood, I had one pair of pants and that!@#s a hobby\nI didn!@#t go hungry, but sometimes I felt worse than them\nSome actions that I fucked up, someone will mention sometimes\nPhones to the clergy, I was unbelievable\nIncredibly stupid, appropriately inappropriate\nAnd time flies like on the number one, water through the dispenser\nThe only humming in my head is $%^You won!@#t make it, young$%^\n$%^You won!@#t make it, kid$%^ ... No, I can make it, take it back!\n\nI feel that the whole world is waiting for me\nI will get it with what I have inside\nIf I have to be alone\nI want to fall there, I want to fall there\nAnd I know that the whole world is waiting above\nI will get it with what I have inside\nI!@#ve had a plan for a long time\nAlthough I am not alone\nI have to go (x4)\n\n\nI always knew that\nIt suits me better yesterday\nI will not find myself today\nIn these next empty words\nIt!@#s all up to me, so\nThe sooner I run for more than me\nMore than me, more than me\nI have a goal\nAnd it just makes me feel different\nI run faster to conquer the world\nBecause what do I have to lose today?\nI have to go (x4)'}
