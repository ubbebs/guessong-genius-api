You gotta... Go... Go... Gotta wait for me? Yeap\n\n\nI!@#m the whitest black man, I!@#m the blackest white man\nI!@#m inhaling grey smoke, it!@#s chocking my lifespan\nRed wine in my left, cigar in my right hand\nGrab my chest. My heart!@#s a jungle with ripe land\nWatch him fight back. Leave them flabbergasted\nLeaving green phlegm in your favorite rapper!@#s casket\nYou know it!@#s fantastic. Spit on the crowd. (That!@#s sick)\nThe raised hands make me mad, you got a question then ask it\nGreedy narcissists; see them leaning now\nPush them over the edge of the bank so I can see them drown\nSpray my bitter seed right out the window, see my semen frown\nNeighbours up my ass: „pal, you think you could keep it down?$%^\nI don!@#t know how. I!@#m just being weird, not being loud\nAnd there!@#s no way I can think of that I could tone the shit down\nBut fuck that, I!@#ll do my best, not a peep or a sound\nI make a serious face, tell the grim reaper „not now$%^, fuck\n\n\n„All my life I!@#ve been considered as the worst\nLying to my mother, even stealing out her purse$%^\nAll my life i!@#ve been considered as a golden child\nMind is broken now, I try to tone it down, I don!@#t know how\n„All my life I!@#ve been considered as the worst\nLying to my mother, even stealing out her purse$%^\nOne of those occasions when a gift is a curse\n„All my life I!@#ve been considered as the worst.$%^\n\n\nNah, that ain!@#t true. I!@#m a good boy\nI want a tattoo cause Rihanna!@#s fucking them rude boys\nI!@#m going crazy on these fucking beats, like a Shrute boy\nI!@#m inside her in a trojan, being like „what it do, troy$%^\nShe grabbed my heart and called it a cute toy\nKarma hit me like DJ Khaled fathering a mute boy\nSaying that shit was a true joy\nThough I!@#m not sure if what I!@#m fucking saying!@#s a true story\nAnyway. When you!@#re making my tombstone\nJust write „here lies a boy, hella young but too grown\nAnd every drop of wine he vomited was a new poem\nBut he flushed the fucking toilet every fucking time, cause it looked wrong$%^\nI!@#m a heartbreaker. It!@#s very true, I can hook you up with hard data\nI!@#m part real, part faker, Me&mic, pepper/salt-shaker\nEscape first, read the charge later. They said I!@#m:\n„Kinda faggy with the artistry$%^. Told them I agree\nBut they didn!@#t like the honesty. I said I!@#m fucking real\nI!@#ve seen gods die and goddesses bleed\nI!@#ve seen the devil dancing tango on the tallest of trees\nExactly, It!@#s beautiful but it!@#s not pretty\nI!@#m gonna be a dumb fuck with a college degree\nSo look at me, doing ballet with led in my bones\nAnd then I!@#m bumping oldies off my cellular phone, whoa\n\n„All my life I!@#ve been considered as the worst\nLying to my mother, even stealing out her purse$%^\nAll my life i!@#ve been considered as a golden child\nMind is broken now, I try to tone it down, I don!@#t know how\n„All my life I!@#ve been considered as the worst\nLying to my mother, even stealing out her purse$%^\nOne of those occasions when a gift is a curse\n„All my life I!@#ve been considered as the worst.$%^'}
