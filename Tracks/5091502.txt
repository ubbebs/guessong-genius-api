We look for well-lit avenues, full of metropolitan motion and hubbub. Residents of Warsaw love to small-talk by music and black coffee. But please do look closely, because people here also deal with other type of affairs…\n\n\nIn offices were brandy, he gave women flowers\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\nIn offices were brandy…\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\n… he gave women flowers\n\n\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\nKids walk aimlessly ‘round the town to shake off their demons\nThis town smells like meat fried in hell\nForty years old passersby still snoop and look furiously\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\nKids fill themselves with vodka, to drown their demons\nMr. officer I’m only dancing\nMr. Mr. Mr. officer, I’m just dancing\nMy lungs tremble again and swirl in waltz\nMilk and honey in this land, that usually flows with smoke and lard\nMr. officer, ooo Mr. officer\n\nCity of concrete and lost phones\nI walk on the street paved in iPhone glass hoarfrost\nShe isn’t here again, so I’m walking home\nWalking alone, so I spill my guts out for you, because I don’t know to whom else (don’t know to whom else!)\nSmoking menthol fags\nThis green pack of fags accentuates my green Nikes\nI usually put all rumours in between those fucking fairytales\nBut now I know why he gives you those likes\nListener\nMeet Peter, me and my ex\nFor many women Peter is a tantalizing taste\nAnd this whole situation gives me a complex\nI’m pretty sure she and this Scoundrel had—\nAnd therefore this text, I’m following them three\nMaybe four weeks, so I’m sketching a prospect\nWhat a tough luck, Peter has many flocks of birds\nGo to Peter and ask - monogamy? - „No, thanks!” Huh!\n\n\nIn offices were brandy, he gave women flowers\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\nIn offices were brandy, he gave women flowers\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\nHe gave women flowers\n\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\nKids walk aimlessly ‘round the town to shake off their demons\nThis town smells like meat fried in hell\nForty years old passersby still snoop and look furiously\nThis town smells like fags and cauliflowers\nKids fill themselves with vodka, to drown their demons\nMr. officer I’m only dancing\nMr. Mr. Mr. officer, I’m just dancing'}
