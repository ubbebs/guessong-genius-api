How much could I do so far already\n\nTell me how many precious moments you have already lost\nHow many days have been wasted\nStop dreaming, yesterday!@#s mistakes mean nothing today\nWake up and finally start living\nTell me how many precious moments you have already lost\nHow many days have been wasted\nStop dreaming, yesterday!@#s mistakes mean nothing today\nWake up and finally start living'}
